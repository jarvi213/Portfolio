            <p>I’m Heather, a front end developer currently deepening her knowledge base through 
            Thinkful’s Full Stack Developer bootcamp. I started coding in order to have the 
            coolest LiveJournal page in high school (oof), but I came back to web development 
            as a career because of how much I enjoy the always-changing landscape of new and 
            novel challenges of web development. Today, I use my skills to take part in 
            development for a nonprofit website. I love taking on challenges with HTML, CSS,
            and Javascript. I’m currently developing skills with Node.js, React, and more.<br>
            <br> When not in front of a computer for work, I enjoy flintknapping (making arrowheads), 
            playing video games, loud guitars (playing and listening), and watching nerdy voice 
            actors play Dungeons & Dragons on Twitch.
